# How to find the Carbon footprint of a warehouse management system?

As Per  warehouse management, we know that the processes running on the system are 
	-Ordering chemicals
	-Allocating to containers
	-Placing it in particular fields
	-Controlling the Job (which means utilizing the chemicals such as empty the chemical and filling it again and so on)

When calculating the emissions, several methods can be used. The two most widely used calculation methods are the energy-based approach and the activity-based approach. The aim of these methods is not to calculate the total carbon footprint of freight transport operations; they only include the direct emissions from the fuel burned in the engine of the transport vehicle itself. 
With an energy-based approach the starting point is the total amount of energy consumed by the transport operations. Based on how much fuel that have been used and the amount of CO2 created when that particular fuel is burned, the emissions can be calculated. Each fuel type has a specific conversion rate, called emission factor, which shows have much CO2 is emitted when a unit of that fuel is burned.

With an activity-based approach the starting point is instead the actual transport activities. The calculation is often based on the combination of weight of goods transported, length of haul and transport mode. A more accurate approach could also include loading factor, type of traffic (e.g. urban or highway) and type of vehicle (e.g. large or small trucks). 
For an activity-based approach there is distance emission factors developed, that is based on the vehicle type used. They explain how much CO2 is emitted when transporting one tonne of goods one kilometer with that vehicle type. If there is no data of what vehicles are used, there are general emission factors for a number of different vehicle types, e.g., light lorry, heavy lorry, container ship, bulk ship etc.
To obtain an accurate estimate of the emissions when using an activity-based approach, factors such as loading factor and transport routes must be known. The activity-based approach is based on the following formula:
"CO2â€ˆemissions = tonnes * kilometer * g CO2  per tonnekm" 

Some average distance emission factors for road, air and sea are 
Road 62g CO2/tonne-km
 Sea 10g CO2/tonne-km
 Air 600g CO2/tonne-km
